# Qogir-dark-circle-modified
Modified variant of Aurorae theme Qogir-dark-circle that's more inline with the Mutter window decoration.

# Upstream
Qogir-kde and the Qogir-(x)-circle variants are from https://github.com/vinceliuice/Qogir-kde

# How does it look?

# Changes
- Made the active title color inline with the GTK window decoration (it was WAY off)
- Centered the titlebar text for 1080p screens when there's no elements but the window buttons

# License
Whatever license it's upstream.
